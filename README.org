#+title: Satori GNU Emacs Configuration

This will be the one place where both configuration and documenting will take place. I was considering to separate both things but that defeats the purpose of learning this amazing tool.

What are the goals of this project?
- learn something deeply
- organise my information (knowledge hub)
- coding
- task management system
- to allow me to achieve my life goals
